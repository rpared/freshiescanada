                        <p> Get your canadian sim card free of cost delivered at your home.Canada has three main providers 
                            (Bell, Telus, & Rogers), and a host of smaller resellers, including a few owned by the “big three” themselves. There are 
                            also a couple of outliers such as Freedom Mobile that have worse coverage and use less common GSM frequencies. While the 
                            company’s 4G/LTE rollout makes it compatible with a wider range of international phones than in the past, most travelers 
                            will still be better off looking elsewhere. So while it may appear at first glance that there are many choices at your mobile 
                            disposal, that’s sadly not the case. Competition is limited between the three companies, with similar, expensive prices across 
                            the board. Below is the link for the Fido (Powered by Rogers) sim card.</p>

                            used on participating public transit systems in the province of Ontario, Canada, specifically in Greater Toronto, Hamilton, 
                            and Ottawa. Presto card readers were implemented on a trial basis from 25 June 2007 to 30 September 2008. Full implementation 
                            began in November 2009 and it was rolled out across rapid transit stations, railway stations, bus stops and terminals, 
                            and transit vehicles on eleven different transit systems.</p>
